{'Reference': ['teness implies all give and little or no return, it is well to recall Coleridge\'s definition of a gentleman: "We feel the gentlemanly character present with us," he said, "whenever, under all circumstances of social intercourse, the trivial, not less than the important, through the whole detail of his manners and deportment, and with the ease of a habit, a person shows respect to others in such a way as at the same time implies, in his own feelings, and habitually, an assured anticipation of reciprocal respect from them to himself. In short, the gentlemanly character arises out of the feeling of equality acting as a habit, yet flexible to the varieties of rank, and modified without being disturbed or superseded by them." Definitions of a gentleman are numerous, and some of them famous; but we do not find such copiousness for choice in definitions of a lady. Perhaps it has been understood all along that the admirable and just characteristics of a gentleman should of necessity be those also of a lady, with the', 'ERVATION PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A PSYCHIC WORLD,\nas real as the world known to our physical senses.\n``And now, because the soul acts at a distance by some power that belongs\nto it, are we authorized to conclude that it exists as something real,\nand that it is not the result of functions of the brain?\n``Does light really exist?\n``Does heat exist?\n``Does sound exist?\n``No.\n``They are only manifestations produced by movement.\n``What we call light is a sensation produced upon our optic nerve\nby the vibrations of ether, comprising between 400 and 756 trillions\nper second, undulations that are themselves very obscure.\n``What we call heat is a sensation produced by vibrations between 350\nand and{sic} 600 trillions.\n``The sun lights up space, as much at midnight as at midday.\nIts temperature is nearly 270 degrees below zero.\n``What we call sound is a sensation produced upon our auditory nerve\nby silent vibrations of the air, themselves comprising between 32,000\nand 36,000 a second.\n', "this truth opens up a vast field for re-examination. It means that we must study all the possible data that can be causes of crime,--the man's heredity, the man's physical and moral &lt;p vii&gt; make-up, his emotional temperament, the surroundings of his youth, his present home, and other conditions,--all the influencing circumstances. And it means that the effect of different methods of treatment, old or new, for different kinds of men and of causes, must be studied, experimented, and compared. Only in this way can accurate knowledge be reached, and new efficient measures be adopted.\nAll this has been going on in Europe for forty years past, and in limited fields in this country. All the branches of science that can help have been working,--anthropology, medicine, psychology, economics, sociology, philanthropy, penology. The law alone has abstained.

Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive in their use of language. These traits seem to be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence. Thus, linguistic invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious process. Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a game to be played for conscious pleasure. Their inventions thus display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence. Further, the electronic media which knit them together are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated specimens.

Professor Huxley, for instance, speaking of the freethinkers of the eighteenth century, admires the acuteness, common sense, wit, and the broad humanity of the best of them, but says "there is rarely much to be said for their work as an example of the adequate treatment of a grave and difficult investigation," and that they shared with their adve', 'ed, unsown cloak.\nHe ate only once a day, and never something cooked.

He saw merchants trading, princes hunting,\nmourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicians\ntrying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day for\nseeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children--and all of this\nwas not worthy of one look from his eye, it all lied, it all stank,\nit all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful and\nbeautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction.

During these wars, in 169, Verus died. We have no means of following the campaigns in detail; but thus much is certain, that in the end the Romans succeeded in crushing the barbarian tribes, and effecting a settlement which made the empire more secure. Marcus was himself comanander-in-chief, and victory was due no less to his own ability than to his wisdom in choice of lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax. There were several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has become celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion. In a battle against the Quadi in 174, the day seemed to he going in favour of the foe, when on a sudden arose a great storm of thunder and rain the lightning struck the barbarians with terror, and they turned to rout.

The shallowness of our inner experience, the hollowness of our worship, and that servile imitation of the world which marks our promotional methods all testify that we, in this day, know God only imperfectly, and the peace of God scarcely at all.\nIf we would find God amid all the religious externals we must first determine to find Him, and then proceed in the way of simplicity. Now as always God discovers Himself to "babes" and hides Himself in thick darkness from the wise and the prudent. We must simplify our approach to Him. We must strip down to essentials (and they will be found to be blessedly few). We must put away all effort to impress, and come with the guileless candor of childhood. If we do this, without doubt God will quickly respond.\nWhen religion has said its last word, there is little that we need other than God Himself. The evil habit of seeking God-and effectively prevents us from finding God in full revelation.

The children themselves appeared in his defence, however, and expressed their complete satisfaction with his administration of their property; and the trumped up charge was wholly disproved. But his enemies still wanted to have him removed and, choosing a new method of attack, forwarded a petition to the king in which they claimed that "Master Hans Chrestensen Sthen because of weakness and old age was incompetent to discharge his duties as a pastor", and asked for his removal to the parishes of Tygelse and Klagstrup. Though the king is reported to have granted the petition, other things seem to have intervened to prevent its execution, and the ill-used pastor appears to have remained at Malmø until his death, the date of which is unknown.\nSthen\'s fame as a poet and hymnwriter rests mainly on two thin volumes of poetry.

Their defense was by means of poison and traps. They would steal through the darkness of the forest and, waiting in ambush, let fly their deadly arrows before they could be discovered. They dug ditches and carefully covered them over with leaves. They fixed spikes in the ground and tipped them with the most deadly poison, and then covered them. Into these ditches and on these spikes man and beast would fall or step to their death.\nA lady once writing to a young man in the navy who was almost a stranger, thought "Shall I close this as anybody would, or shall I say a word for my Master?" and, lifting up her heart for a moment, she wrote, telling him that his constant change of scene and place was an apt illustration of the word, "Here we have no continuing city," and asked if he c', ', day by day, so\nChrist is able\nin heaven now to do what He could not do when He was on earth--to keep in the closest fellowship with every believer throughout the whole world. Glory be to God! You know that text in Ephesians: "He that descended is the same also that ascended, that He might fill all things." Why was my Lord Jesus taken up to heaven away from the life of earth? Because the life of earth is a life confined to localities, but the life in heaven is a life in which there is no limit and no bound and no locality, and Christ was taken up to heaven, that, in the power of God, of the omnipresent God, He might be able to fill every individual here and be with every individual believer.\nThat is what my heart wants to realize by faith; that is a possibility, that is a promise, that is my birthright, and I want to have it, and I want by the grace of God to say, "Jesus, I will not rest until Thou hast revealed Thyself fully to my soul."\nThere are often very blessed expe', 'to one of them publicly was already sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical attention. Belief in them had become a mark of inferiority, like the allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.\nBut though the theology of Christianity had thus sunk to the lowly estate of a mere delusion of the rabble, propagated on that level by the ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites, the ethics of Christianity continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance, and perhaps even more acceptance than ever before. It seemed to be generally felt, in fact, that they simply must be saved from the wreck--that the world would vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting them. In this fear a great many judicious men joined, and so there arose what was, in essence, an absolutely new Christian cult--a cult, to wit, purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by generations of theologians, and harking back to what was conceived to be the pure ethical doc', 'r guided by the example of Christ in the treatment of enemies; therefore they cannot be agreeable to the will of God, and therefore their overthrow by a spiritual regeneration of their subjects is inevitable.\n"We regard as unchristian and unlawful not only all wars, whether offensive or defensive, but all preparations for war; every naval ship, every arsenal, every fortification, we regard as unchristian and unlawful; the existence of any kind of standing army, all military chieftains, all monuments commemorative of victory over a fallen foe, all trophies won in battle, all celebrations in honor of military exploits, all appropriations for defense by arms; we regard as unchristian and unlawful every edict of government requiring of its subjects military service.\n"Hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms, and we cannot hold any office which imposes on its incumbent the obligation to compel men to do right on pain of imprisonment or death.

That is the highest and most profitable lesson, when a man\ntruly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself.

"I seek not Mine own glory" (John 8:50) "The words that I say, I speak not from Myself" (John 14: 10). "The word which ye hear is not Mine" (John 14: 24).\nThese words open to us the deepest roots of Christ\'s life and work. They tell us how it was that the Almighty God was able to work His mighty redemptive work through Him. They show what Christ counted the state of heart which became Him as the Son of the Father. They teach us what the essential nature and life is of that redemption which Christ accomplished and now communicates. It is this: He was nothing, that God might be all. He resigned Himself with His will and His powers entirely for the Father to work in Him. Of His own power, His own will, and His own glory, of His whole mission with all His works and His teaching, of all this He said, It is not I; I am nothing', 'down in hell, and yet Thou art there also. For if I go down into hell, Thou art there.

Jehovah!\nTHE STORY OF JOSEPH.\nPharaoh had a dream, and this dream was interpreted by Joseph.\nAccording to this interpretation there was to be in Egypt seven years of plenty, followed by seven years of famine. Joseph advised Pharaoh to buy all the surplus of the seven plentiful years and store it up against the years of famine.\nPharaoh appointed Joseph as his minister or agent, and ordered him to buy the grain of the plentiful years.\nThen came the famine. The people came to the king for help. He told them to go to Joseph and do as he said.\nJoseph sold corn to the Egyptians until all their money was gone -- until he had ', 'of speech, out of indignation at his malicious disposition towards Adam. Besides this, he inserted poison under his tongue, and made him an enemy to men; and suggested to them, that they should direct their strokes against his head, that being the place wherein lay his mischievous designs towards men, and it being easiest to take vengeance on him, that way. And when he had deprived him of the use of his feet, he made him to go rolling all along, and dragging himself upon the ground. And when God had appointed these penalties for them, he removed Adam and Eve out of the garden into another place. \nCHAPTER 2.\nConcerning The Posterity Of Adam, And The Ten Generations From Him To The Deluge,\n1. Adam and Eve had two sons: the elder of them was named Cain; which name, when it is interpreted, signifies a possession: the younger was Abel, which signifies sorrow. They had also daughters.

Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger--"\n"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so ', 'sly."\n"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.

She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing: she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\'s had been on the side of honesty against importance. She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\n"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Lady Russell, looking over her paper, "much may be done.

'You are the proper person to ask me.'\nShe flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child's ready to cry.\nMeanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us.

The fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and then stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and understanding: "Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you gone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my daughter? Won\'t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what else can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A plague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come back, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you who ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?"\nThe goatherd\'s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, who said to him, "As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will soothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself," and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.\nThe goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and then said, "I should be sorry if your wo', 'me here as I stand.

With his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain satisfaction. But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovna\'s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household. He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification.

I often let my legs drop, and\ncould feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to\nstruggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this\ntime the storm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I\nwalked near a mile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured\nwas about eight o'clock in the evening. I then advanced forward\nnear half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or\ninhabitants; at least I was in so weak a condition, that I did not\nobserve them.

We went down the hill and found Joe Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar", 'a corresponding sneer--the hour for parting came; and the grief of that moment was considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton addressed to her pupil. Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to philosophise, or that it armed her in any way with a calmness, the result of argument; but it was intolerably dull, pompous, and tedious; and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss Sedley did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions of private grief. A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawing-room, as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents, and these refreshments being partaken of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to depart.\n"You\'ll go in and say good-by to Miss Pinkerton, Becky!" said Miss Jemima to a young lady of whom nobody took any notice, and who was coming downstairs with her own bandbox.\n"I suppose I must," said Miss Sharp calmly, and much to the wonder of Miss Jemima; and the latter having knocked', 'lemen, "we ask you if you do not deeply love the King of the Bulgarians?"\n"Not at all," said he; "for I have never seen him."\n"What! he is the best of kings, and we must drink his health."\n"Oh! very willingly, gentlemen," and he drank.\n"That is enough," they tell him.

There he was made to wheel about to the right, and to the left, to draw his rammer, to return his rammer, to present, to fire, to march, and they gave him thirty blows with a cudgel. The next day he did his exercise a little less badly, and he received but twenty blows.

Had Mrs. Goodchild ever spoken to this creature? Then he realized it was merely a fashion of speaking, and he approached, one pudgy fist uplifted.

At intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation. There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse, uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals. They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse tow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of sandal, and many wore an iron collar. The small boys and girls were always naked; but nobody seemed to know it.

For he was a sincere man, and in spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one. And it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man watches himself too closely.

Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.\nFrom these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation. In the ', "unt of vapor for animals and vegetables to flourish.\n5.

It means that we must study all the possible data that can be causes of crime,--the man's heredity, the man's physical and moral &lt;p vii&gt; make-up, his emotional temperament, the surroundings of his youth, his present home, and other conditions,--all the influencing circumstances. And it means that the effect of different methods of treatment, old or new, for different kinds of men and of causes, must be studied, experimented, and compared. Only in this way can accurate knowledge be reached, and new efficient measures be adopted.\nAll this has been going on in Europe for forty years past, and in limited fields in this country.

Even with respect to the\nideas of great men are we certain that they are exclusively the\noffspring of their brains?

The editor of a newspaper was always a printer and often composed his articles as he set them in type; so "composing" came to mean typesetting, and one who sets type is a compositor. Now James needed an apprentice. It happened then that young Benjamin, at the age of thirteen, was bound over by law to serve his brother.\nJames Franklin printed the "New England Courant", the fourth newspaper to be established in the colonies. Benjamin soon began to write articles for this newspaper. Then when his brother was put in jail, because he had printed matter considered libelous, and forbidden to continue as the publisher, the newspaper appeared in Benjamin\'s name.\nThe young apprentice felt that his brother was unduly severe and, after serving for about two years, made up his mind to run away. Secretly he took passage on a sloop and in three days reached New York, there to find that the one printer in the town, William Bradford, could give him no work. Benjamin then set out for Philadelphia. By boat', 'ts had been seeking a panacea for all the ills to which flesh is heir, indeed for something which would enable men even to defy Death, and the subtle new spirit was eagerly proclaimed as the long-looked-for cure-all, if not the very aqua vitæ itself. Physicians introduced it to their patients, and were lavish in their praises of its curative powers. The following is quoted from the writings of Theoricus, a prominent German of the sixteenth century, as an example of medical opinion of alcohol in his day:--\n"It sloweth age, it strengtheneth youth, it helpeth digestion, it cutteth phlegme, it cureth the hydropsia, it healeth the strangurie, it pounces the stone, it expelleth gravel, it keepeth the head from whirling, the teeth from chattering, and the throat from rattling; it keepeth the weasen from stiffling, the stomach from wambling, and the heart from swelling; it keepeth the hands from shivering, the sinews from shrinking, the veins from crumbling, the bones from aching, and the marrow', 't instigated by love of knowledge]\nIn fact, the history of physical science teaches (and we cannot too carefully take the lesson to heart) that the practical advantages, attainable through its agency, never have been, and never will be, sufficiently attractive to men inspired by the inborn genius of the interpreter of nature, to give them courage to undergo the toils and make the sacrifices which that calling requires from its votaries. That which stirs their pulses is the love of knowledge and the joy of the discovery of the causes of things sung by the old poets--the supreme delight of extending the realm of law and order ever farther towards the unattainable goals of the infinitely great and the infinitely small, between which our little race of life is run. In the course of this work, the physical philosopher, sometimes intentionally, much more often unintentionally, lights upon something which proves to be of practical value. Great is the rejoicing of those who are benefited thereby; and, for the ', "t as though I had stumbled into the eighteenth century and were calling on Giambattista Vico. After a brief inspection by a young man with the appearance of a secretary, I was told that I was expected, and admitted into a small room opening out of the hall. Thence, after a few moments' waiting, I was led into a much larger room. The walls were lined all round with bookcases, barred and numbered, filled with volumes forming part of the philosopher's great library. I had not long to wait. A door opened behind me on my left, and a rather short, thick-set man advanced to greet me, and pronouncing my name at the same time with a slight foreign accent, asked me to be seated beside him. After the interchange of a few brief formulae of politeness in French, our conversation was carried on in Italian, and I had a better opportunity of studying my host's air and manner. His hands he held clasped before him, but frequently released them, to make those vivid gestures with which Neapolitans frequently clinch their phrase.", 'ical and chemical condition in which it moves.\nIt is comprehensible that a person could not have arrived at such a\nfar-reaching change of view by continuing to follow the old beaten\npaths, but only by introducing some sort of new idea. Indeed,\nEinstein arrived at his theory through a train of thought of great\noriginality. Let me try to restate it in concise terms.\nTHE EARTH AS A MOVING CAR\nEveryone knows that a person may be sitting in any kind of a vehicle\nwithout noticing its progress, so long as the movement does not vary\nin direction or speed; in a car of a fast express train objects fall\nin just the same way as in a coach that is standing still. Only when\nwe look at objects outside the train, or when the air can enter the\ncar, do we notice indications of the motion. We may compare the earth\nwith such a moving vehicle, which in its course around the sun has\na remarkable speed, of which the direction and velocity during a\nconsiderable period of time may be regarded as constant. In place\nof the a', "that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man. This subject of sexual selection has been treated at full length in the present work, simply because an opportunity was here first afforded me. I have been struck with the likeness of many of the half-favourable criticisms on sexual selection, with those which appeared at first on natural selection; such as, that it would explain some few details, but certainly was not applicable to the extent to which I have employed it. My conviction of the power of sexual selection remains unshaken; but it is probable, or almost certain, that several of my conclusions will hereafter be found erroneous; this can hardly fail to be the case in the first treatment of a subject. When naturalists have become familiar with the idea of sexual selection, it wi", 'for I should soon have got over my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable for all my future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my incapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the hospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still have vivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to allow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at least a dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work. My father, who was by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew, declared that I', 'gement to the very\nvaluable Journals of Poggendorff and Schweigger.

Indeed, we have been often astonished to see with what\ncelerity every thing, even moderately valuable in the scientific\npublications of this country, finds its way into their pages.\nThis ought to encourage our men of science.

The mercury column falls rapidly, but finally remains stationary, and at this level another scratch is made on the tube and the point is marked 32°. The space between these two points, which represent the temperatures of boiling water and of melting ice, is divided into 180 equal parts called degrees. The thermometer in use in the United States is marked in this way and is called the Fahrenheit thermometer after its designer. Before the degrees are etched on the thermometer the open end of the tube is sealed.\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Determining one of the fixed points of a thermometer.]\nThe Centigrade thermometer, in use in foreign countries and in all scientific work, is similar to the Fahrenheit except that the fixed points are marked 100° and 0°, and the interval between the points is divided into 100 equal parts instead of into 180.\nThe boiling point of\n', 'Gratiolet appears to overlook inherited habit, and even to some extent habit in the individual; and therefore he fails, as it seems to me, to give the right explanation, or any explanation at all, of many gestures and expressions. As an illustration of what he calls symbolic movements, I will quote his remarks (p. 37), taken from M. Chevreul, on a man playing at billiards. "Si une bille devie legerement de la direction que le joueur pretend zlui imprimer, ne l\'avez-vous pas vu cent fois la pousser du regard, de la tete et meme des epaules, comme si ces mouvements, purement symboliques, pouvaient rectifier son trajet? Des mouvements non moins significatifs se produisent quand la bille manque d\'une impulsion suffisante. Et cliez les joueurs novices, ils sont quelquefois accuses au point d\'eveiller le sourire sur les levres des spectateurs." Such movements, as it appeirs to me, may be attributed simply to habit. As often as a man has wished to move an object to one side, he has always pushed it to that side when forwards, he has pushed it forwards; and if he has wished to arrest it, he has pulled backwards. Therefore, when a man sees his ball travelling in a wrong direction, and he intensely wishes it to go in another direction, he cannot avoid, from long habit, unconsciously performing movements which in other cases he has found effectual.\nAs an instance of sympathetic movements Gratiolet gives (p. 212) the following case:--"un jeune chien A oreilles droites, auquel son maitre presente de loin quelque viande appetissante, fixe avec ardeur ses yeux sur cet objet dont il suit tous les mouvements, et pendant que les yeux regardent, les deux oreilles se portent en avant comme si cet objet pouvait etre entendu."

And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be produced or developed.\nThe industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from this point of view. The Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's List, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and Colonial Review, all papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of premium, were unanimous on this point.

At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course.

This was no other than Gideon Spilen, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.\nGideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain exact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest possible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald, are genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with. Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great merit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having traveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in council, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor danger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for his journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subj', 'however, that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me.\nI do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes, because, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single one where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many hours later.

She thought the attendant had been unfair, and spasms of rage shook her. The glass valves had closed, she could not go back. She saw, at the end of the vestibule, the lift in which she had ascended going quietly up and down, empty. Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas.

Of course a revolving platform ran the length of the boat, but she was expected to walk from it to her cabin. Some cabins were better than others, and she did not get the best. She thought the attendant had been unfair, and spasms of rage shook her. The glass valves had closed, she could not go back. She saw, at the end of the vestibule, the lift in which she had ascended going quietly up and down, empty. Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas.

She might have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle here which needs straightening to."

Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the public.\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this part of Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown church. The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had made his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a considerable fund of local lore.

For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum!

What delight for the jaded senses of the reader is this enchanted domain of wonder-pieces! What an atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What resources of imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One might almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to a half faith in the old superstition of the significance of anagrams, found, in the transposed letter', 'marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road. Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the door. But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. Suppose a man had fired through the window, he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare; there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house. No one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.\nAll day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavo', 'rely delivered from the black vapour which disturbed it.

"No, dear brother," said the sultan, "you must answer me, I will take no denial." Shaw- zummaun, not being able to withstand these pressing entreaties, replied, "Well then, brother, I will satisfy you, since you command me ;" and having told him the story of the queen of Samarcand\'s treachery "This," said he, "was the cause of my grief; judge whether I had not sufficient reason for my depression."\n"O! my brother," said the sultan, (in a tone which shewed what interest he took in the king of Tartary\'s affliction), "what a horrible event do you tell me!

But a sergeant who had nine wounds and was a brave fellow, begged not to be put to so much shame. And the blower let him down easily, so that he came to no harm, and he bade him go to the king and tell him that whatever regiments he liked to send more should be blown away just the same. And the king, when he got the message, said,\n"Let the fellows be; they have some right on their side."

He had a little library made up of old numbers of The Union Jack , Pluck and The Halfpenny Marvel . Every evening after school we met in his back garden and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe Dillon's war dance of victory. His parents went to eight- o'clock mass every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs. Dillon was prevalent in the hall of the house.

Perhaps it grieves him to be at such a distance from his dominions, or from the queen, his wife: Alas! if that be the matter, I must forthwith give him the presents I designed for him, that he may return to Samarcande when he pleases.\' Accordingly, next day Schahriar sent him a part of those presents, being the greatest rarities and the richest things that the Indies could afford.

Nevertheless, she would not look at the gift cab too closely, and she stepped into the warm interior.\nThe windows were veiled with the snow and the sleet which had been falling all the time she had been in the theatre.

He was well preserved and his little imperial and short grey moustache were trimmed with military precision, yet his hair was almost white, and his age could scarcely be less than sixty. In his way he was quite as interesting as the girl. His eyes, underneath his thick brows, were dark and clear, and his features were strong and delicately shaped. His hands were white and very shapely, the fingers were rather long, and he wore two singularly handsome rings, both set with strange stones. By the side of the table rested the stick upon which he had been leaning during his passage through the room. It was of smooth, dark wood polished like a malacca cane, and set at the top with a curious, green, opalescent stone, as large as a sparrow\'s egg.

There was no bell or knocker, so, lifting the latch, I pushed the door open and entered.\nBut if the court itself had been a surprise, this was a positive wonder, a dream. Here, within earshot of the rumble of Fleet Street, I was in an old-fashioned garden enclosed by high walls and, now that the gate was shut, cut off from all sight and knowledge of the urban world that seethed without. I stood and gazed in delighted astonishment. Sun-gilded trees and flower beds gay with blossom; lupins, snapdragons, nasturtiums, spiry foxgloves, and mighty hollyhocks formed the foreground; over which a pair of sulphur-tinted butterflies flitted, unmindful of a buxom and miraculously clean white cat which pursued them, dancing across the borders and clapping her snowy paws fruitlessly in mid-air. And the background was no less won', 't is to be done?\n"I see only one way out of the difficulty: Let us divide the spoils. A half-million for you; a half-million for me. Is not that a fair division? In my opinion, it is an equitable solution, and an immediate one. I will give you three days time to consider the proposition. On Thursday morning I shall expect to read in the personal column of the Echo de France a discreet message addressed to M. Ars. Lup, expressing in veiled terms your consent to my offer. By so doing you will recover immediate possession of the ticket; then you can collect the money and send me half a million in a manner that I will describe to you later.\n"In case of your refusal, I shall resort to other measures to accomplish the same result.

Why they never heard of me! Perhaps their grandfathers remember me, some of them!" and she laughed a harsh, croaking laugh. And then I am bound to say that she astonished me, for she handed me back the ring with a certain suggestion of old-fashioned grace which was not without its pathos.\nThe old man eyed her with a sort of sudden ferocity, half rising from his stool, and said to me suddenly and hoarsely:\n"Let me see!"\nI was about to hand the ring ', 'as open at the top,\nand he had distinctly heard the jingling of a hansom bell.\nHe threw open the bottom sash and leaned out.

Once more he looked out\nof the window. The cabman was leaning forward in his seat with his head\nresting upon his folded arms. He was either tired out or asleep. The\nattitude of the horse was one of extreme and wearied dejection. Wrayson\nwas on the point of closing the window when he became aware for the first\ntime that the cab had an occupant.

He knew pretty well why he was getting fired; he just didn\'t quite know how to put it into words. It\'d only been a couple of hours since his high school friend and CEO had told him what was happening. "I mean, they gave me reasons, but they\'re not really reasons. They\'re not things I did wrong."\n"What does that mean? They didn\'t like your looks?"\n"Yeah, basically," said Paul. "More to the point, they didn\'t like the look of how I was doing things.

She was a woman with a "job"; Captain Woodhouse had never before met one such.\nAgain, here was a woman who tried none of the stale arts and tricks of coquetry; no eyebrow strategy or maidenly simpering about Jane Gerson. Once sure Woodhouse was what she took him to be, a gentleman, the girl had established a frank basis of comradeship that took no reckoning of the age-old conventions of sex allure and sex defense. The unconventionality of their meeting weighed nothing with her. Equally there was not a hint of sophistication on the girl\'s part.\nSo the afternoon sped, and when the sun dropped over the maze of spires and chimney pots that was Paris, each felt regret at parting.\n"To Egypt, yes," Woodhouse ruefully admitted. "A dreary deadly \'place in the sun\' for me. To have met you, Miss Gerson; it has been delightful, quite."\n"I hope," the girl said, as Woodhouse handed her into a taxi, "I hope that if that war comes it will find', 'nal low, rounded mound, a menhir or a dolmen, and (if such may be termed features) great pits that opened in the earth like cold craters, which the countryfolk termed avens.

They were Mr. Fogg\'s usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England-- all rich and highly respectable personages, even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and finance.\n"Well, Ralph," said Thomas Flanagan, "what about that robbery?"\n"Oh," replied Stuart, "the Bank will lose the money."\n"On the contrary," broke in Ralph, "I hope we may put our hands on the robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he\'ll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers."\n"But have you got the robber\'s description?" asked Stuart.\n"In the first place, he is no robber at all," returned Ralph', 'cked their nuts for a season, "what do you say?"\n"I\'ll think the matter over, and talk with my wife," said Mr. Shelby. "Meantime, Haley, if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way you speak of, you\'d best not let your business in this neighborhood be known.

On the whole we found them good-natured and companionable fellows, notwithstanding their interest in baksheesh which we were compelled at last, in self-defense, to fix at one piaster an hour. We frequently shared with them our frugal, and even scanty meals; and in turn they assisted us in our purchases and arrangements for lodgings, for their word, we found, was with the common people an almost unwritten law.

These\nthings Psammetichos did and gave him this charge wishing to hear what\nword the children would let break forth first after they had ceased\nfrom wailings without sense.

There was no waiting-room, no refreshment room; the cars were locked; and for at least another hour, or so it seemed, we had to camp upon the draughty, gaslit platform.

Ora per ragioni di politica e di amministrazione tutto quanto quel paese si mise in rivolta, e capo dell'insurrezione è Suleiman, il figlio di Ziber pacha.

Nearly all our tall vessels had been cut down for coal-barges, and were being ignominiously towed by the nose from port to port, while many worthy captains addressed themselves to Sailors\' Snug Harbor.\nThe next day I landed at Fairhaven, opposite New Bedford, and found that my friend had something of a joke on me. For seven years the joke had been on him. The "ship" proved to be a very antiquated sloop called the Spray, which the neighbors declared had been built in the year 1. She was affectionately propped up in a field, some distance from salt water, and was covered with canvas. The people of Fairhaven, I hardly need say, are thrifty and observant. For seven years they had asked, "I wonder what Captain Eben Pierce is going to do with the old Spray?"

The Indian reminding us that he could not work without eating, we stopped to breakfast on the main shore southwest of Deer Island. We took out our bags, and the Indian made a fire under a very large bleached log, using white pine bark from a stump, though he said that hemlock was better, and kindling with canoe birch bark. Our table was a large piece of freshly peeled birch bark, laid wrong side up, and our breakfast consisted of hard-bread, fried pork, and strong coffee well sweetened, in which we did not miss the milk.\nWhile we were getting breakfast a brood of twelve black dippers,[2] half grown, came paddling by within thr', "n several occasions\nthis has necessitated journeys out of Sydney on the writer's part.

Tobacco-coloured soil was still under our feet, yellow spattered lava, then again reddish soil, wonderfully rich and fertile, if only it could be cultivated. The country was here peculiar for its many undulations until we arrived on the rim of a large basin, extending from north-west to south-east, of great campos, with stunted vegetation at first, but later with a truly luxuriant growth of vigorous-looking Jtauba preta (Oreodaphne Hookeriana Meissn.), with thick deep green foliage.\nWe crossed two streamlets flowing north. On going uphill we travelled on masses of volcanic pellets (elev. 2,500 ft.). To the south we could see a number of hills, the sides of which showed the great effects of erosion by wind and water. Nearly all those hill ranges extended from east to west. A long depression could be observed cutting them from north to south.\nThat was a fine day for cloud effects, especially along the horizon, where they displayed horizontal lines, while they had great ball-like tops. Higher up, to the north-west, was feathery mist turning the sky to a delicate pale blue.

They went by way of the Great Lakes; and from Green Bay, in canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin. Marquette had solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that if the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would name it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all explorers traveled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four with him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of meat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other requisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint chroniclers of the time phrased it, to 'explain hell to the savages.'\nOn the 17th of June, 1673, the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and their five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the Mississippi. Mr. Parkman says: 'Before them a wide and rapid current coursed athwart their way, by the "], 'War': ['CHUAN, adding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that the bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu -- we should call them apocryphal -- similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine Situations [15] is preserved in the T`UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin\'s commentary. It is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and answer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU LU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH`UN CH`IU: "The King of Wu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he set forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him." As he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above- mentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.

At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature a', "onderful world of ours.

Now that is literally scientifically\ntrue, that a diamond is an actual deposit\nof carbon from the sun. The old priest told Ali\nHafed that if he had one diamond the size of\nhis thumb he could purchase the county, and if\nhe had a mine of diamonds he could place his\nchildren upon thrones through the influence of\ntheir great wealth.\nAli Hafed heard all about diamonds, how much\nthey were worth, and went to his bed that night\na poor man. He had not lost anything, but he\nwas poor because he was discontented, and\ndiscontented because he feared he was poor. He\nsaid, ``I want a mine of diamonds,'' and he lay\nawake all night.\nEarly in the morning he sought out the priest.\nI know by experience that a priest is very cross\nwhen awake", "this nervous little chap.\nThere was a tray of drinks on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a stiff whisky-and-soda. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the glass as he set it down.\n'Pardon,' he said, 'I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead.'\nI sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe.\n'What does it feel like?' I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to deal with a madman.\nA smile flickered over his drawn face. 'I'm not mad - yet. Say, Sir, I've been watching you, and I reckon you're a cool customer. I reckon, too, you're an honest man, and not afraid of playing a bold hand. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in.'\n'Get on with your yarn,' I said, 'and I'll tell you.'\nHe seemed to brace himself for a great effort, and then started on the queerest rigmarole. I didn't get hold of it at first, and I had to stop and ask him questions. But here is the gis", 'but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone among the\nArgives shall be without one. This is not well; for you behold,\nall of you, that my prize is to go elsewhither."\nAnd Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond\nall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We\nhave no common store from which to take one. Those we took from\nthe cities have been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that\nhave been made already. Give this girl, therefore, to the god,\nand if ever Jove grants us to sack the city of Troy we will\nrequite you three and fourfold."\nThen Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall\nnot thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not\npersuade me. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely\nunder my loss and give up the girl at your bidding?

He never yet had thought of his daughter except as a mere child, and he did not mean for an instant to intimate that her growing interest in the young lieutenant was anything more than a "school-girl" fancy. She was old enough, however, to take his thoughtless speech au sérieux, and it hurt her.\n"Papa!" was her one, indignant word of remonstrance. She would not even defend herself against such accusation.\n"I know!--I understand--I didn\'t mean it except as the merest joke, my child," he hurriedly interposed.

It was true that the speedy coming of Dr. and Mrs. Gra', 'avery of the aboriginals is outweighed by the intelligence of the\ninvaders and their superior force of character. During the second\ncentury of the Mohammedan era, when the inhabitants of Arabia went forth\nto conquer the world, one adventurous army struck south. The first\npioneers were followed at intervals by continual immigrations of Arabs\nnot only from Arabia but also across the deserts from Egypt and Marocco.\nThe element thus introduced has spread and is spreading throughout the\nSoudan, as water soaks into a dry sponge. The aboriginals absorbed the\ninvaders they could not repel. The stronger race imposed its customs and\nlanguage on the negroes. The vigour of their blood sensibly altered the\nfacial appearance of the Soudanese. For more than a thousand years the\ninfluence of Mohammedanism, which appears to possess a strange\nfascination for negroid races, has been permeating the Soudan, and,\nalthough ignorance and natural obstacles impede the progress of new\nideas, the whole of the black race is gradually ado', "made me one of their own. I shall never be able to repay all the loving thoughts and deeds of that family and shall remember them while I live. My chum's mother I call Mother too. It is to her that I have dedicated this book.\nAfter my delightful few days of leave, things moved fast. I was back in Dover just two days when I, with two hundred other men, was sent to Winchester. Here we were notified that we were transferred to the Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment.\nThis news brought a wild howl from the men. They wanted to stop with the Fusiliers. It is part of the British system that every man is taught the traditions and history of his regiment and to know that his is absolutely the best in the whole army. In a surprisingly short time they get so they swear by their own regiment and by their officers, and they protest bitterly at a transfer.\nPersonally I didn't care a rap. I had early made up my mind that I was a very small pebble on the beach and that it was up to me to obey ord", 'y yes sure."\nHe looked at her again, and then dropped his eyes. He had lashes.\n"I\'m awful," he said sadly. "I\'m diff\'runt. I don\'t know why I make faux pas. \'Cause I don\'t care, I s\'pose." Then, recklessly: "I been smoking too much.

I\'ve done a lot of things that if my fambly knew"he hesitated, giving her imagination time to picture dark horrors"I went to the burlesque show last week."\nMyra was quite overcome. He turned the green eyes on her again. "You\'re the only girl in town I like much," he exclaimed in a rush of sentiment. "You\'re simpatico."\nMyra was not sure that she was, but it sounded stylish though vaguely improper.\nThick dusk had descended outside, and as the limousine made', "othing she paused from time to time to listen for sounds from the next apartment.\nWhat was her neighbor doing now? Had he read of the discovery of the man's body in the street? Perhaps he had fled already? Not a sound was to be heard there. He did not look in the least like what Jane imagined a murderer would, yet certainly the circumstances pointed all too plainly to his guilt. She had seen two men dash around the corner, one in pursuit of the other. One of them had come back alone. Not long afterward a body--the body of the other man--had been found with a bullet in his heart. It must have been a murder.\nWhat ought she to do about it? Was it her duty to tell her mother and Dad about what she had seen? Mother, she knew, would be horrified and would caution her to say nothing to any one, but Dad was different. He had strict ideas about right and justice. He would insist on hearing every word she had to tell.

The\nundertaking did not prove a success. Lincoln had no business experience\nand no particular business capacity, while his partner proved to be\nuntrustworthy. The partner decamped, leaving Lincoln to close up the\nbusiness and to take the responsibility for the joint indebtedness. It\nwas seventeen years before Lincoln was able, from his modest earnings as\na lawyer, to clear off this indebtedness. The debt became outlawed in\nsix years' time but this could not affect Lincoln's sense of the\nobligation. After the failure of the business, Lincoln secured work as\ncounty surveyor. In this, he was following the example of his\npredecessor Washington, with whose career as a surveyor the youngster\nwho knew Weems's biography by heart, was of course familiar. His new\noccupation took him through the county and brought him into personal\nrel", "nfederates would have made a great mistake in attacking us at all in such a position, if we had been prepared to receive them. But this want of preparation prevented us from taking advantage of the opportunity, and inflicting a crushing defeat upon the South. By it the war was prolonged, and every village and hamlet in the West had its house of mourning.\nImmediately in the right rear of General Sherman was camped the veteran division of General McClernand. About two miles further back, and about a mile from the river, was stationed the reserve, consisting of two divisions, Hurlbut's and W. H. L. Wallace's, formerly C. F. Smith's. Across Owl Creek, and seven or eight miles off, was camped General Lew Wallace's division. It was so far away as not to be in easy supporting distance.\nOn April 1st, our division was marched to an open field, and there carefully reviewed by General Grant.

Indeed he knows no more about the dramatic art than, according to his own story in "The Man of Destiny," Napoleon at Tavazzano knew of the Art of War. But both men were successes each in his way--the latter won victories and the former gained audiences, in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war and the theatre. Shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have his characters make long speeches at one another, apparently thinking that this embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of bombast and rhetoric. There never was an author who showed less predilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results. He recognized, early in his days, many things awry in the world and he assumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit. It seems such a small job at twenty to set the times', "ements. Germany, with her submarine policy of ruthlessness, changed the Atlantic Ocean into another No Man's Land across which every American soldier had to pass at the mercy of the enemy before he could arrive at the actual battle-front.\nThis was the peril of the troop ship. This was the tremendous advantage which the enemy held over our armies even before they reached the field. This was the unprecedented condition which the United States and Allied navies had to cope with in the great undertaking of transporting our forces overseas.\nAny one who has crossed the ocean, even in the normal times before shark-like Kultur skulked beneath the water, has experienced the feeling of human helplessness that comes in mid-ocean when one considers the comparative frailty of such man-made devices as even the most modern turbine liners, with the enormous power of the wilderness of water over which one sails.\nIn such times one realises that safety rests, first upon the kindliness of the elements; secon", 'wn, the firing, which had grown fiercer and fiercer, gradually died out.\nHe was intently straining his ears, when to his surprise the afternoon sun began to flash upon the weapons of armed men, and once more his hopes revived in the belief that the French were being driven back; but to his astonishment and dismay, as they came more and more into sight, a halt seemed to have been called, and they too settled down into a bivouac, and communications by means of mounted men took place between them and the halted party higher up the valley; the young rifleman, by using great care, watching the going to and fro unseen.\nEvening was coming on, and Pen Gray was still watching and wondering whether it would be possible to take advantage of the darkness, when it fell, to try and pass down the valley, circumvent the enemy, and overtake their friends, when the wounded boy\'s eyes unclosed, and he lay gazing wonderingly in his comrade\'s eyes.\n"Better, Punch?" said Pen softly.\n"What\'s the matter?"', "perambulator and some hot and dusty children lagging fretfully behind; some rustic sightseers draining the last dregs of the daylight in an effort to make out from their guide-books which of these reverend piles was which; a policeman and a builder's cart. Of course the club was a strange one, both of my own being closed for cleaning, a coincidence expressly planned by Providence for my inconvenience. The club which you are 'permitted to make use of' on these occasions always irritates with its strangeness and discomfort. The few occupants seem odd and oddly dressed, and you wonder how they got there. The particular weekly that you want is not taken in; the dinner is execrable, and the ventilation a farce. All these evils oppressed me to-night. And yet I was puzzled to find that somewhere within me there was a faint lightening of the spirits; causeless, as far as I could discover.

But that is not evidence; and not even Sam Weller at his gayest would have dared to offer it as such in the Court of Common Pleas. So far, then, nothing remotely approaching proof has been offered as to any supernatural intervention during the Retreat from Mons. Proof may come; if so, it will be interesting and more than interesting.\nBut, taking the affair as it stands at present, how is it that a nation plunged in materialism of the grossest kind has accepted idle rumours and gossip of the supernatural as certain truth? The answer is contained in the question: it is precisely because our whole atmosphere is materialist that we are ready to credit anything--save the truth. Separate a man from ', 'as you like. All you got to do is sit down and wait as quiet as you can. Then pretty soon you\'ll find out I was right."\nHis comrade grunted stubbornly. For a moment he seemed to be searching for a formidable reply. Finally he said: "Well, you don\'t know everything in the world, do you?"\n"Didn\'t say I knew everything in the world," retorted the other sharply. He began to stow various articles snugly into his knapsack.\nThe youth, pausing in his nervous walk, looked down at the busy figure. "Going to be a battle, sure, is there, Jim?" he asked.\n"Of course there is," replied the tall soldier. "Of course there is. You jest wait \'til to-morrow, and you\'ll see one of the biggest battles ever was. You jest wait."\n"Thunder!" said the youth.\n"Oh, you\'ll see fighting this time, my boy, what\'ll be regular out-and-out fighting," added the tall soldier, with the air of a man who is about to exhibit a battle for the benefit of his friends.\n"Huh!" said the loud one from a cor', "ng purposes, at a scale of one per seven officers. It was impossible for everyone to read at the same time. We used to sit over the fire for warmth and the three nearest to the lamp could manage to see sufficiently in the evenings to read the few Tauchnitz editions we had been able to purchase through a tradesman, who was allowed into the barracks twice a week.\nAs nearly all great-coats and waterproofs had been taken away from prisoners at the time of their capture, we felt the effects of the cold pretty considerably. Roll-calls took place at 8 a.m. and 9.30 p.m., generally out of doors. We often went on these roll-calls in the early days with our blankets over our shoulders. A welcome supply of soldiers' great-coats was sent through the American Embassy about Christmas time. During the first winter there were about 250 Russians, 200 French, 120 English and a few Belgian officers in the camp.\nThat first winter was by far the worst of the three I spent there. We had not got to understand the true", 'ry in our advance on Nu-Yok.\nFortunately our contact guard had been able to leap into the upper branches of a tree without being discovered by the Bad Bloods, for their discipline was lax and their guard careless. She overheard enough of the conversation of their Bosses around the camp fire beneath her to indicate the general nature of the Han plans.\nAfter several hours she was able to leap away unobserved through the topmost branches of the trees, and after putting several miles between herself and their camp, she ultrophoned a full report to her Contact Boss back in the Wyoming Valley. My own Ultrophone Field Boss picked up the message and brought the graph record of it to me at once.\nHer report was likewise picked up by the Bosses of the various Gang units in our line, and we had called a council to discuss our plans by word of mouth.\nWe were gathered in a sheltered glade on the eastern slope of First Mountain on a balmy night in May. Far to the east, across the forested slopes ', 'ore Nicholas had not worn well. At the age of seven he had been an extraordinarily beautiful child, but after that he had gone all to pieces; and now, at the age of twenty-five, it would be idle to deny that he was something of a mess. For the three years preceding his twenty-fifth birthday, restricted means and hard work had kept his figure in check; but with money there had come an ever-increasing sleekness. He looked as if he fed too often and too well.\nAll this, however, Sally was prepared to forgive him, if he would only make a good speech. She could see Mr. Faucitt leaning back in his chair, all courteous attention. Rolling periods were meat and drink to the old gentleman.\nFillmore spoke.\n"I\'m sure," said Fillmore, "you don\'t want a speech... Very good of you to drink our health. Thank you."\nHe sat down.\nThe effect of these few simple words on the company was marked, but not in every case identical. To the majority the emotion which they brought was one of unmixed reli', 'rybody belong to a gang nowadays?"\n"Naturally," she said, frowning. "If you don\'t belong to a gang, where and how do you live? Why have you not found and joined a gang? How do you eat? Where do you get your clothing?"\n"I\'ve been eating wild game for the past two weeks," I explained, "and this clothing I--er--ah--." I paused, wondering how I could explain that it must be many hundred years old.\nIn the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I could, piecing it together with my assumptions as to what had happened. She listened patiently; incredulously at first, but with more confidence as I went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a long time.\n"That\'s hard to believe," she said, "but I believe it." She looked me over with frank interest.\n"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down in that mine?" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never married. "Well, that simplifies matters," she continued. "You see, if you were technically classe'], 'Western': ['e crack of a shot, and the sheriffs gun dropped from his hand. All eyes turned in the direction of the entrance. There stood Texas Pete, his shooting iron smoking in his hand.\n"You damn pole-cat!" he exclaimed, his eyes on Gum. "Come on, Bull; this ain\'t no place for quiet young fellers like us."\nBull wheeled Blazes and rode slowly through the doorway, with never a glance toward the sheriff; nor could he better have shown his utter contempt for the man. There had always been bad blood between them. Smith had been elected by the lawless element of the community and at the time of the campaign Bull had worked diligently for the opposing candidate who had been backed by the better element, consisting largely of the cattle owners, headed by Elias Henders.\nWhat Bull\'s position would have been had he not been foreman for Henders at the time was rather an open question among the voters of Hendersville, but the fact remained that he had been foreman and that he had worked to such good purpose for', 'with a keener interest, for she had seen a great deal of merciless riding since she came West and it always angered her. The cowpunchers used "hoss-flesh" rather than horses, a distinction that made her hot. If a horse were not good enough to be loved it was not good enough to be ridden. That was one of her maxims. She stepped closer to the window. Certainly that pony had been cruelly handled for the little grey gelding swayed in rhythm with his panting; from his belly sweat dripped steadily into the dust and the reins had chafed his neck to a lather. Marianne flashed into indignation and that, of course, made her scrutinize the rider more narrowly. He was perfect of that type of cowboy which she detested most: handsome, lithe, childishly vain in his dress. About his sombrero ran a heavy width of gold-braid; his shirt was blue silk; his bandana was red; his boots were shop-made beauties, soft and flexible; and on his heels glittered--gilded spurs!\n"And I\'ll wager," thought the indignant Maria', 'dim old shop and the noisy, bustling city beset him strongly, despite his years of a life unfitting him for the hardships of the prairies and mountains. Being able to read Greek and Latin was no asset on the open trail; although schoolmasters would be needed in that new country.\n"I know how you feel, Mr. Boyd. Have you seen your father since you landed?"\nTom reluctantly shook his head. "It would only reopen the old bitterness and lead to further estrangement. No man shall ever speak to me again as he did--not even him. If you should see him, Jarvis, tell him I asked you to assure him of my affection."\n"I shall be glad to do that," replied the clerk. "You missed him by only two days. He asked for you and wished you success, and said your home was open to you when you returned to resume your studies. I think, in his heart, he is proud of you, but too stubborn to admit it." As he spoke he chanced to glance through the window of the store. "Don\'t look around," he warned. "I want to tell you t', 'Is thet all yeh want o\' me? \'Cause ef \'tis I got t\' git on t\' camp. It\'s a good five mile yet, an\' I \'ain\'t hed no grub sence noon."\nThe tears suddenly rushed to the girl\'s eyes as the horror of being alone in the night again took possession of her. This dreadful man frightened her, but the thought of the loneliness filled her with dismay.\n"Oh!" she cried, forgetting her insulted dignity, "you\'re not going to leave me up here alone, are you? Isn\'t there some place near here where I could stay overnight?"\n"Thur ain\'t no palace hotel round these diggin\'s, ef that\'s what you mean," the man leered at her. "You c\'n come along t\' camp \'ith me ef you ain\'t too stuck up."\n"To camp!" faltered Margaret in dismay, wondering what her mother would say. "Are there any ladies there?"\nA loud guffaw greeted her question. "Wal, my woman\'s thar, sech es she is; but she ain\'t no highflier like you. We mostly don\'t hev ladies to camp, But I got t\' git on. Ef you want to go too, you better light', 'gone from camp to camp in Idaho--some too strange, too horrible for credence--and with every rumor the fame of Kells had grown, and also a fearful certainty of the rapid growth of a legion of evil men out on the border. But no one in the village or from any of the camps ever admitted having seen this Kells. Had fear kept them silent? Joan was amazed that Roberts evidently knew this man.\nKells dismounted and offered his hand. Roberts took it and shook it constrainedly.\n"Where did we meet last?" asked Kells.\n"Reckon it was out of Fresno," replied Roberts, and it was evident that he tried to hide the effect of a memory.\nThen Kells touched his hat to Joan, giving her the fleetest kind of a glance. "Rather off the track aren\'t you?" he asked Roberts.\n"Reckon we are," replied Roberts, and he began to lose some of his restraint. His voice sounded clearer and did not halt.

"I don\'t pretend to know now all you mean."\nCalhoun whirled on him fiercely, with a vigor which his wasted frame did not indicate as possible.\n"Listen, then, and I will tell you what John Calhoun means--John Calhoun, who has loved his own state, who has hated those who hated him, who has never prayed for those who despitefully used him, who has fought and will fight, since all insist on that. It is true Tyler has offered me again to-day the portfolio of secretary of state. Shall I take it? If I do, it means that I am employed by this administration to secure the admission of Texas. Can you believe me when I tell you that my ambition is for it all--all, every foot of new land, west to the Pacific, that we can get, slave or free? Can you believe John Calhoun, pro-slavery advocate and orator all his life, when he says that he believes he is an humble instrument destined, with God\'s aid, and through the use of such inst', 'und a heap. Say, how about dinner? You got it started? I\'m gettin\' powerful hungry."\nJune knew the subject was closed. She might have pushed deeper into her father\'s reticence, but some instinct shrank from what she might uncover. There could be only pain in learning the secret he so carefully hid.\nThere had been no discussion of it between them, nor had it been necessary to have any. It was tacitly understood that they would have little traffic with their neighbors, that only at rare intervals would Pete drive to Meeker, Glenwood Springs, or Bear Cat to dispose of furs he had trapped and to buy supplies. The girl\'s thoughts and emotions were the product largely of this isolation. She brooded over the mystery of her father\'s past till it became an obsession in her life. To be brought into close contact with dishonor makes one either unduly sensitive or callously indifferent. Upon June it had the former effect.\nThe sense of inferiority was branded upon her. She had seen girls giggling at t', 'uiet, incessant eye? Such an eye as this did the pony keep upon\nwhatever man took the rope. The man might pretend to look at the\nweather, which was fine; or he might affect earnest conversation\nwith a bystander: it was bootless. The pony saw through it. No\nfeint hoodwinked him. This animal was thoroughly a man of the\nworld. His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon the dissembling foe,\nand the gravity of his horse-expression made the matter one of\nhigh comedy. Then the rope would sail out at him, but he was\nalready elsewhere; and if horses laugh, gayety must have abounded\nin that corral. Sometimes the pony took a turn alone; next he had\nslid in a flash among his brothers, and the whole of them like a\nschool of playful fish whipped round the corral, kicking up the\nfine dust, and (I take it) roaring with laughter. Through the\nwindow-glass of our Pullman the thud of their mischievous hoofs\nreached us, and the strong, humorous curses of the cow-boys. Then\nfor the first time I noticed a man who sat on the high gate', 'some one had drawn up her window shades. Carley promptly pulled them down and settled herself comfortably. Then she heard a woman speak, not particularly low: "I thought people traveled west to see the country." And a man replied, rather dryly. "Wal, not always." His companion went on: "If that girl was mine I\'d let down her skirt." The man laughed and replied: "Martha, you\'re shore behind the times. Look at the pictures in the magazines."\nSuch remarks amused Carley, and later she took advantage of an opportunity to notice her neighbors. They appeared a rather quaint old couple, reminding her of the natives of country towns in the Adirondacks. She was not amused, however, when another of her woman neighbors, speaking low, referred to her as a "lunger." Carley appreciated the fact that she was pale, but she assured herself that there ended any possible resemblance she might have to a consumptive. And she was somewhat pleased to hear this woman\'s male companion forcibly voice her own convictions. In fact', 'He found his companions dining, and joining them, he made a good meal, and at its conclusion all hands repaired to the bar again, and indulged in several more drinks.\nJesse then startled his companions by pulling out his big wad of bills, and paying the landlord for their fare.\nThe moment the gang got him alone, Frank whispered:\n"Where did you get the roll, Jess?"\n"From Jack Wright," laughed the outlaw.\n"Tell us about it!"\n"Certainly. It was the easiest game I ever played, and I got $5,000 out of it, too. Ha, ha, ha!"\nLooks of intense astonishment appeared on the faces of his friends.\nHe then explained what he had done.\nA roar of delight went up from the gang when he finished.\n"Bully for you, Jess!"\n"Oh, Lord, what a game!"\n"You\'ve done splendidly."\n"What a roasting for the bank!"', 'tire to the life of a country gentleman.\nHis sister\'s voice cut into his musing. She had two tones. One might be called her social register. It was smooth, gentle--the low-pitched and controlled voice of a gentlewoman. The other voice was hard and sharp. It could drive hard and cold across a desk, and bring businessmen to an understanding that here was a mind, not a woman.\nAt present she used her latter tone. Vance Cornish came into a shivering consciousness that she was sitting beside him. He turned his head slowly. It was always a shock to come out of one of his pleasant dreams and see that worn, hollow-eyed, impatient face.\n"Are you forty-nine, Vance?"\n"I\'m not fifty, at least," he countered.\nShe remained imperturbable, looking him over. He had come to notice that in the past half-dozen years his best smiles often failed to mellow her expression. He felt that something disagreeable was coming.\n"Why did Cornwall run away this morning? I hoped to take him on a trip."', "he\nwas a restless, headstrong girl, even then, who liked to astonish her\nfriends. Later, when I knew her, she was always doing something\nunexpected. She gave one of her town houses for a Suffrage headquarters,\nproduced one of her own plays at the Princess Theater, was arrested for\npicketing during a garment-makers' strike, etc. I am never able to believe\nthat she has much feeling for the causes to which she lends her name and\nher fleeting interest. She is handsome, energetic, executive, but to me\nshe seems unimpressionable and temperamentally incapable of enthusiasm.\nHer husband's quiet tastes irritate her, I think, and she finds it worth\nwhile to play the patroness to a group of young poets and painters of\nadvanced ideas and mediocre ability. She has her own fortune and lives her\nown life. For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden.\nAs for Jim, no disappointments have been severe enough to chill his\nnaturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though it\noften made him s", 'h telegraphed and wrote, begging piteously to be permitted to accompany them on the long journey by way of San Francisco, and so it had finally been settled. The colonel\'s household were now at regimental headquarters up at Prescott, and Angela was quite happy at Camp Sandy. She had been there barely four weeks when Neil Blakely, pale, fragile-looking, and still far from strong, went to report for duty at his captain\'s quarters and was met at the threshold by his captain\'s daughter.\nExpecting a girl friend, Kate Sanders, from "down the row," she had rushed to welcome her, and well-nigh precipitated herself upon a stranger in the natty undress uniform of the cavalry. Her instant blush was something beautiful to see. Blakely said the proper things to restore tranquillity; smilingly asked for her father, his captain; and, while waiting for that warrior to finish shaving and come down to receive him, was entertained by Miss Wren in the little army parlor. Looking into her wondrous eyes and happy, blushing ', 'ended this Mormon Elder by being a friend to that woman."\n"Ma\'am, is it true--what he says?" asked the rider of Jane, but his quiveringly alert eyes never left the little knot of quiet men.\n"True? Yes, perfectly true," she answered.\n"Well, young man, it seems to me that bein\' a friend to such a woman would be what you wouldn\'t want to help an\' couldn\'t help....What\'s to be done to you for it?"\n"They intend to whip me. You know what that means--in Utah!"\n"I reckon," replied the rider, slowly.\nWith his gray glance cold on the Mormons, with the restive bit-champing of the horses, with Jane failing to repress her mounting agitations, with Venters standing pale and still, the tension of the moment tightened. Tull broke the spell with a laugh, a laugh without mirth, a laugh that was only a sound betraying fear.\n"Come on, men!" he called.\nJane Withersteen turned again to the rider.\n"Stranger, can you do nothing to save Venters?"\n"Ma\'am, you ask me', 'o, no; go on; don\'t wait for me," he answered. But neither Charley nor I was inclined to do that.\nDick was soon on his feet again, while we assisted him, in spite of what he had said, to get up his horse. The animal\'s leg did not appear to be strained, and Dick quickly again climbed into the saddle.\n"Thank you, my dear boys," he exclaimed, "it must not happen again; I am a heavy weight for my brute, and, if he comes down, you must go on and let me shift for myself."\nWe made no reply, for neither Charley nor I was inclined to desert our brave friend. The rest of the party had dashed by, scarcely observing what had taken place, the Indians taking the lead. It was impossible to calculate how many miles we had gone. Night was coming on, making the glare to the eastward appear brighter and more terrific. The mules were still instinctively following us, but we were distancing them fast, though we could distinguish their shrieks of terror amid the general uproar.\nThe hill for which we wer', '-except as they might have been reminded of the dreary distance from the glitter and the tinsel of the East. The mountains, distant and shining, would have meant nothing to them; the strong, pungent aroma of the sage might have nauseated them.\nBut Miss Benham had caught her first glimpse of Manti and the surrounding country from a window of her berth in the car that morning just at dawn, and she loved it. She had lain for some time cuddled up in her bed, watching the sun rise over the distant mountains, and the breath of the sage, sweeping into the half-opened window, had carried with it something stronger--the lure of a virgin country.\nAunt Agatha Benham, chaperon, forty--maiden lady from choice--various uncharitable persons hinted humorously of pursued eligibles--found Rosalind gazing ecstatically out of the berth window when she stirred and awoke shortly after nine. Agatha climbed out of her berth and sat on its edge, yawning sleepily.\n"This is Manti, I suppose," she said acridly, shov', 'tracks. Now is the time when the wild mustangs and the buffaloes go southward, and the Indians follow in the chase. The Kiowas are all right, for we arranged with them for the road, but the Apaches and Comanches know nothing of it, and we don\'t dare let them see us. We have finished our part, and are ready to leave this region; hurry up with yours, and do likewise. Remember there\'s danger, and good-by."\nSam looked gravely after his retreating form, and pointed to a footprint near the spring where we had paused for parting. "He\'s quite right to warn us of Indians," he said.\n"Do you mean this footprint was made by an Indian?"\n"Yes, an Indian\'s moccasin.

So what was there for Frieda to do but each day to grow fairer and more charming, like a lovely wax doll that had come to life and taken upon itself the airs and graces of a really grown-up person. Because Jack objected, Frieda some time ago had given up her former fashion of wearing her heavy yellow hair in a Psyche knot, and in these months at the ranch when no strangers were about had returned to her old childish custom of two long braids. On dress occasions, however, her coiffure, copied after a Paris model, could again be made bewilderingly lovely.\nOn this particular occasion Frieda had unfortunately neglected to attire herself for the role which she was about to play, as she happened to be wearing an old blue and white middy blouse and a short duck ', 'right.

Almost immediately it was dissipated by the wind, but when the peaks again showed, we stared with astonishment to see that they were white with snow.

Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight.

There is much in starting right. A stumble in the start often defeats the race, while a good strike at the onset often wins the victory. There is no more alarming feature in the Girlhood of our times than its apparent indifference to the great work before it. Multitudes of girls are as thoughtless and giddy as the lambs that sport on the lea. They seem scarcely to cast a prophetic glance before. They live as though life was a theater, good for nothing but its acting. I know there is much reason why girls do live so, why they are so heedless of the grandeur that swells into eternal glory before them. I know they have been taught by the customs of society, by the follies of their elders, to regard themselves as the playthings of men, the ornaments of society, rather than the helpers of themselves and their race, and the solid substance of the social fabric.', 'of libertine.

My mother had done her utmost to persuade me that I was capable of great achievements; but my father, who thought ambition was the surest road to ruin, and change but another word for destruction, would listen to no scheme for bettering either my own condition, or that of my fellow mortals. He assured me it was all rubbish, and exhorted me, with his dying breath, to continue in the good old way, to follow his steps, and those of his father before him, and let my highest ambition be to walk honestly through the world, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, and to transmit the paternal acres to my children in, at least, as flourishing a condition as he left them to me.\n'Well! - an honest and industrious farmer is one of the most useful members of society; and if I devote my talents to the cultivation of my farm, and the improve", 'ightly and joyfully as one who commonly and habitually feels well, and sometimes she stooped a little and was preoccupied.

She was vehemently impatient--she did not clearly know for what--to do, to be, to experience. And experience was slow in coming. All the world about her seemed to be--how can one put it? --in wrappers, like a house when people leave it in the summer. The blinds were all drawn, the sunlight kept out, one could not tell what colors these gray swathings hid. She wanted to know. And there was no intimation whatever that the blinds would ever go up or the windows or doors be opened, or the chandeliers, that seemed to promise such a blaze of fire, unveiled and furnished and lit.

Victoria took it hesitatingly.\n'Don't you remember me?' he said. 'My name's Cairns. Major Cairns. You know. Travancores. Met you at His Excellency's hop.'\nOf course she remembered him. He was so typical. Anybody could have told his profession and his rank at sight. He had a broad humorous face, tanned over freckled pink. Since he left Wellington he had grown a little in every direction and had become a large middle aged boy. Victoria took him in at one look.

She has, therefore, lately used her utmost endeavors to obtain a faithful account of whatever related to her ill-advised daughter; the result of which giving her some reason to apprehend, that, upon her death-bed, she bequeathed an infant orphan to the world, she most graciously says, that if you, with whom she understands the child is placed, will procure authentic proofs of its relationship to her, you may sent it to Paris, where she will properly p', 'mptoms, then you are afflicted with Dyspepsia, and should endeavor to obtain relief.
