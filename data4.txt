{'Young Readers': ['ay from it--generally to England and to\nschool. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their\nfathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from\nthem. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and\nthough sometimes her father\'s stories of the voyage and the new\ncountry had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought\nthat he could not stay with her.\n"Couldn\'t you go to that place with me, papa?" she had asked when\nshe was five years old. "Couldn\'t you go to school, too? I\nwould help you with your lessons."\n"But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little\nSara," he had always said. "You will go to a nice house where\nthere will be a lot of little girls, and you will play together,\nand I will send you plenty of books, and you will grow so fast\nthat it will seem scarcely a year before you are big enough and\nclever enough to come back and take care of papa."\nShe had liked to think of that. To keep the house for her\nfather; to ride with him, and sit at th', 't talk of cats or dogs if you don\'t like them!" When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam back to her; its face was quite pale (with rage, Al-ice thought), and it said in a low, weak voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I\'ll tell you why it is I hate cats and dogs."\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was by this time quite crowded with the birds and beasts that had slipped in-to it. Al-ice led the way and they all swam to the shore. \nCHAPTER III.\nA RACE.\nThey were a queer look-ing crowd as they stood or sat on the bank--the wings and tails of the birds drooped to the earth; the fur of the beasts clung close to them, and all were as wet and cross as could be.\n[Illustration]\nThe first thought, of course, was how to get dry. They had a long talk a-bout this, and Al-ice joined with, them as if she had known them all her life. But it was hard to tell what was best.\n"What I want to say," at last spoke up t', 'to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\'s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\n"Say, Jim, I\'ll fetch the water if you\'ll whitewash some."\nJim shook his head and said:\n"Can\'t, Mars Tom. Ole mi', 'as stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said:\n"Oh, she\'ll do. That\'s all right. Huck can come in."\nThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.\n"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what\'s the line of business of this Gang?"\n"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.\n"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--"\n"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\'t robbery; it\'s burglary," says Tom Sawyer. "We ain\'t burglars. That ain\'t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money."\n"Must we always kill the people?"\n"Oh, certainly. It\'s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it\'s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they\'re ra', 'specially those of the Middle and Lower Thirds, seemed to enjoy the importance of owning something which it was in their power to withhold.\n"I\'m waiting till I\'ve heard what you all six have to say for yourselves," said Kitty Palgrave condescendingly. "I shan\'t make up my mind until the very last minute."\n"It\'s so difficult to choose between you," added Ellie Simpson, a pert little person of twelve.\nTheir tone verged on the offensive, and in any other circumstances Dorothy would have administered a snub. As it was, she pocketed her pride, and merely said she hoped they would remember her. She heard them snigger as she turned away, and longed to go back and shake them; but discretion prevailed.\n"One has to put up with this sort of thing if one wants to get returned Warden," she reflected. "All the same, it\'s sickening to be obliged to truckle to young idiots like that."\nShe had not by any means found all the possible voters, so she decided to return to the Juniors\' Common Roo', 'll times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women." Everybody sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn\'t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother\'s shoulder and sobbed out, "I am a selfish girl! But I\'ll truly try to be better, so he mayn\'t be disappointed in me by-and-by."\n"We all will," cried Meg. "I think too much of my looks and hate to work, but won\'t any more, if I can help it."\n"I\'ll try and be what he loves to call me, \'a little woman\' and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to', 'often. Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might,\ncould make nothing of it and her afternoon\'s enjoyment was spoiled.\n"I\'ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find\nout from Marilla where he\'s gone and why," the worthy woman\nfinally concluded. "He doesn\'t generally go to town this\ntime of year and he NEVER visits; if he\'d run out of turnip\nseed he wouldn\'t dress up and take the buggy to go for more;\nhe wasn\'t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. Yet\nsomething must have happened since last night to start him\noff. I\'m clean puzzled, that\'s what, and I won\'t know a\nminute\'s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has\ntaken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today."\nAccordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not\nfar to go; the big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where\nthe Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the\nroad from Lynde\'s Hollow. To be sure, the long lane made it\na good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert\'s father, as shy and\nsilent as his son after him, had got a', "unt of vapor for animals and vegetables to flourish.\n5. Venus has the brightest lustre of our planets which is caused from enormous amount of vapor. It is carried over its orbit at about 67,000,000 miles from the sun, which requires 224 7/10 days to complete its course. Rotates once every 23 hours and 21 minutes. Diameter, 7,700 miles.\n6.

At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:\n"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS"\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, "Is your name Dorothy, my dear?"\n"Yes," answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\n"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you."\n"Where is this city?" asked Dorothy.\n"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of."\n"Is he a good man?" inquired the girl anxiously.\n"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him."\n"How can I get there?" asked Dorothy.\n"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.', 'at who can."\nThe Fox and the Goat\nA FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape. A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. "If," said he, "you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards." The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat\'s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, "You foolish old fellow! If ', 'eating very quietly, and hardly raised their heads as the black frightful thing came puffing and grinding past.\nFor the first few days I could not feed in peace; but as I found that this terrible creature never came into the field, or did me any harm, I began to disregard it, and very soon I cared as little about the passing of a train as the cows and sheep did.\nSince then I have seen many horses much alarmed and restive at the sight or sound of a steam engine; but thanks to my good master\'s care, I am as fearless at railway stations as in my own stable.\nNow if any one wants to break in a young horse well, that is the way.\nMy master often drove me in double harness with my mother, because she was steady and could teach me how to go better than a strange horse. She told me the better I behaved the better I should be treated, and that it was wisest always to do my best to please my master; "but," said she, "there are a great many kinds of men; there are good thoughtful men like our ', 'person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain.\n"Well," said he, "my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him, particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We\'ll put it, for argument like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we\'ll put it, if you like, that that cheek\'s the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?"\nI told him he was out walking.\n"Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?"\nAnd when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions, "Ah," said he, "this\'ll be as good as drink to my mate Bill."\nThe expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. Th', "said, 'I\ninwented it.'\n'You, Mr. Bumble!'\n'I, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The\nlast was a S,--Swubble, I named him. This was a T,--Twist, I\nnamed him. The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next\nVilkins. I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet,\nand all the way through it again, when we come to Z.'\n'Why, you're quite a literary character, sir!' said Mrs. Mann.\n'Well, well,' said the beadle, evidently gratified with the\ncompliment; 'perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.' He\nfinished the gin-and-water, and added, 'Oliver being now too old\nto remain here, the board have determined to have him back into\nthe house. I have come out myself to take him there. So let me\nsee him at once.'\n'I'll fetch him directly,' said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for\nthat purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the\nouter coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed,\nas could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room", ",sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA\n.ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA\nShe puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright\nthought struck her.

However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he\nwould not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox,\nand heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and\ndid not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said,\n'Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.' So he sat down, and\nthe fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick\nthat their hair whistled in the wind.\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox's counsel, and\nwithout looking about him w", 'eateningly, and off\nhe went again. "Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down,\nbut I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings -- don\'t\nspeak -- measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes\ntwo fifteen six -- don\'t waggle your finger -- whooping-cough,\nsay fifteen shillings" -- and so on it went, and it added up\ndifferently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,\nwith mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles\ntreated as one.\nThere was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a\nnarrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen\nthe three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom\'s Kindergarten\nschool, accompanied by their nurse.\nMrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling\nhad a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of\ncourse, they had a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount\nof milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland\ndog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular un', 'called them to consider themselves prisoners, and to deliver up the sack, or be cut in pieces.\n"Prisoners, say you?" said the man who could blow, "suppose you first have a little dance together in the air," and holding one nostril, and blowing through the other, he sent the regiments flying head over heels, over the hills and far away. But a sergeant who had nine wounds and was a brave fellow, begged not to be put to so much shame. And the blower let him down easily, so that he came to no harm, and he bade him go to the king and tell him that whatever regiments he liked to send more should be blown away just the same. And the king, when he got the message, said,\n"Let the fellows be; they have some right on their side." So the six comrades carried home their treasure, divided it among them, and lived contented till they died.\nCLEVER GRETHEL\nTHERE was once a cook called Grethel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she went out in them she gave herself great airs, and though', "council made up of the chief men of this land of Ithaka.

And one said,\n'Because his father, Odysseus, was king, this youth thinks he should be\nking by inheritance.
